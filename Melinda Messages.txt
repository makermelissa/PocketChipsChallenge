Level 50	Picking up chips is what the challenge is all about. But on ice, Chip gets chapped and feels like a chump instead of a champ.

Level 60	Chip hits the ice and decides to chill out. Then he runs into a fake wall and turns the maze into a thrash-a-thon!

Level 70	Chip is halfway through the world's hardest puzzle. If he suceeds, maybe the kids will stop calling him computer breath!

Level 80	Chip used to spend his time programming computer games and making models. But that was just practice for this brain-buster!

Level 90	'I can do it! I know I can!' Chip thinks as the going gets tougher. Besides, Melinda the Mental Marvel waits at the end.

Level 100	Besides being an angel on earth, Melinda is the top scorer in the Challenge--and the president of the Bit Busters.

Level 110	Chip can't wait to join the Bit Busters! The club's already figured out the school's password and accessed everyone's grades!

Level 120	If Chip's grades aren't as good as Melinda's, maybe she'll come over to his house and help him study!

Level 130	'I've made it this far,' Chip thinks. 'Totally fair, with my mega-brain.' Then he starts the next maze. 'Totally unfair!' he yelps.

Level 140	Groov-u-loids! Chip makes it almost to the end. He's stoked!
